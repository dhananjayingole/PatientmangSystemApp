# 🏥 Patient Management System — Android App

A full-featured healthcare management Android application built with **Jetpack Compose**, **Firebase Realtime Database**, and **Firebase Authentication**. The app supports two roles — **Admin (Doctor/Staff)** and **Patient (User)** — with real-time data sync, appointment booking, prescription management, and emergency SOS alerts.

## ✨ Features

### 👨‍⚕️ Admin Panel
- **Dashboard** — live stats: total patients, appointments today, pending emergency alerts
- **Patient Management** — add, edit, delete patient records with full medical profile
- **Prescription Management** — create and update prescriptions with multiple medicines (name, dosage, frequency, duration, timing)
- **Appointment Management** — view all appointments, confirm, cancel, or mark as completed with optional notes
- **Emergency Alerts** — view incoming SOS alerts with GPS location, update response status (responding / resolved)
- **User Management** — view all registered users, delete accounts
- **Auto account linking** — when a patient is added via the appointment flow, their Firebase Auth UID is silently linked to the patient record so prescriptions sync automatically to their app

### 👤 Patient (User) Panel
- **Dashboard** — upcoming appointments, recent prescriptions, quick actions
- **Book Appointment** — select doctor, specialty, date, time, and reason
- **My Appointments** — view all past and upcoming appointments with status
- **My Prescriptions** — view prescriptions issued by doctors, including all medicine details
- **Notifications** — real-time push notifications for appointment confirmations, prescription updates, and emergency responses
- **Emergency SOS** — one-tap alert with live GPS location sent to admin
- **Yoga & Exercises** — browse yoga poses with detail screens
- **Profile** — update name and phone number

## 🔗 Patient ↔ User Account Linking Flow

This is a key design decision that makes prescriptions automatically appear on the patient's phone:

```
1. Patient registers / books appointment via the app
   └── Appointment saved with userId = Firebase Auth UID

2. Admin confirms appointment

3. When patient arrives, admin taps "Add as Patient" on the appointment card
   └── AdminAddEditPatientScreen opens with:
       - prefillName  = appointment.userName
       - prefillUserId = appointment.userId   ← silently carried

4. Admin fills in age, blood group, etc. and saves
   └── Patient record saved with userId = the linked UID

5. Admin creates a prescription for that patient
   └── AdminViewModel.savePrescription() copies userId from the patient record
       into the prescription automatically

6. Prescription now visible on the patient's "My Prescriptions" screen
   └── UserViewModel queries prescriptions WHERE userId == currentUser.uid
```

No manual UID entry required at any step.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Hedgehog or newer
- JDK 17
- A Firebase project

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhananjayingole/PatientmangSystemApp.git
   cd PatientmangSystemApp
   ```

2. **Create a Firebase project**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   - Create a new project
   - Add an Android app with package name `eu.tutorials.patientmanagementapp`
   - Download `google-services.json` and place it in the `app/` folder

3. **Enable Firebase services**
   - Authentication → Email/Password sign-in
   - Realtime Database → Start in test mode (then add rules below)

4. **Set Firebase Realtime Database rules**
   ```json
   {
     "rules": {
       ".read": "auth != null",
       ".write": "auth != null"
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Set admin role**
   In Firebase Realtime Database, manually set the role for your admin account:
   ```
   users/{adminUid}/role = "admin"
   ```
   Regular users have `role = "user"` (set automatically on registration).

6. **Build and run**
   Open in Android Studio → Sync Gradle → Run on device or emulator (API 26+)

## 🔑 User Roles

| Role | How to set | Access |
|---|---|---|
| `admin` | Manually set `role: "admin"` in Firebase for that user's UID | Full admin dashboard |
| `user` | Set automatically on registration | Patient dashboard |

On login, the app reads the role from Firebase and routes to the correct dashboard automatically.

## 🐛 Known Issues Fixed

- **Patients not showing in prescription screen** — caused by each screen creating its own `AdminViewModel` instance via `= viewModel()` default. Fixed by creating one shared instance in `NavGraphSetup` and passing it explicitly to all admin screens.
- **Auth race condition on cold start** — users were landing on the login screen briefly even when already authenticated because `userRole` was `null` while Firebase was still loading. Fixed by showing a `CircularProgressIndicator` while `isAuthenticated == true` but `userRole == null`.
- **Prescriptions not appearing for patients** — fixed by ensuring `userId` is copied from the patient record into every prescription at save time inside `AdminViewModel.savePrescription()`.
